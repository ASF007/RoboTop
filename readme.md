## Discord Bot Base


A subclass of `commands.Bot` which implements the following features
and reduces the boilerplate between discord bots.

This supports Nextcord, if you wish to use this with Disnake please express interest and I can see what to do.
Pycord has no pypi releases so don't ask, this is a 2.x.x template.

### Disclaimer

I am fine with this being used for personal/private usage. 
However, I am not fine with other people using this for things such as tutorials, etc, without first contacting me and getting approval. Don't be that guy.
